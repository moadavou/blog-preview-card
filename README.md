## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use local font files and host the fonts myself instead of using a link to Google Fonts.

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: fontname;
    src: url(...);
}
```

### Continued development

I'm bad at estimating the time it takes for me to complete a project. I tend to do other things, lose focus, or have a difficult time beginning the project.

In the future, I want to improve my focus so I can complete the project closer to the estimated timeframe.
